# ðŸš€ SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

SpaceX has revolutionized space travel with the Falcon 9 rocket, which can reuse its first stage, drastically reducing launch costs. This project aims to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully using historical launch data. Accurate predictions can help SpaceX and stakeholders estimate mission costs, optimize planning, and enhance operational efficiency.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

SpaceX offers launches at approximately $62 million, while competitors charge over $165 million. This cost advantage comes from reusing the first stage. Predicting landing success is critical for reducing operational risks and ensuring cost-effective launches.

**Key Question:**

> Can we predict the success of a Falcon 9 first stage landing based on historical launch parameters?

Explored key patterns using SQL and Python visualizations.

Analyzed relationships between variables and landing outcomes.

4. *Model Building*

Developed machine learning models to predict landing success.

Evaluated models using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. *Dashboard Creation*

Built an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard to visualize launch data and predictions.
